For this project, I used AI a bit more than the last one.  I asked it a few questions about how to do some css stuff, specifically how to mesh the js and css to get the adaptive gradient.  I also used it to get some free endpoints that I copy pasted into postman to get test data that I could compare to what I was recieving with my js code.  I found it really helpful for parsing through the API documentation and getting those endpoints.  I also technically used some AI overviews from some google searches, but I usually just clicked on the links that it provided instead of taking directly from the overview.
